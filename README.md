Custom Color Tampermonkey / Greasmonkey Scripts for Editor Colors in SAP Web IDE

For Chrome users, you will need to install the Tampermonkey extension:

Tampermonkey is also avaliable for firefox users:     
[https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)

IMPORTANT: In the script, make sure to put your "s" username in the url!    
(I'm not sure if there are other types of user names for the Web IDE, but if there are, put it there. You just want the @match line to be the same as your personal webide URL.)

As far as I've tested, and I've been using it in full productive scenarios, the script affects only color and no functionality of the IDE. Make an issue if you find one!

Coming soon: more color schemes in addition to Monokai.
